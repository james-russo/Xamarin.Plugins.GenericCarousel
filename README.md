# Xamarin.Plugins.GenericCarousel

This work is based on the original design by acastr7 and his contributors.  However, I wanted to be able to use a "carousel" on any view rather than be tied down to an the Image class specifically.  So I present this repository, I've not yet made a Nuget Package, but hope to do so some time after the Holidays.   

I've stripped this out of a working project, which is not open source, but thought this might be useful for some one else. 

This code is give as is, with no warrenties or guarenteed support. I'll do my best to accomodate any issues in my spare time. 

Hope someone finds this useful!
