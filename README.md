# Xamarin.Plugins.GenericCarousel

This work is based on the original design by acastr7 and his contributors.  However, I wanted to be able to use a "carousel" on any view rather than be tied down to an the Image class specifically.  So I present this repository, I've not yet made a Nuget Package, but hope to do so some time after the Holidays.   

Update 2-24-2016:

I've updated the project to ensure the correc types are being added to the carousel and removed the requirement to implement swiping on the views and ability for navigation.  These both have been abstracted out into interfaces. 

Currently only Android has been implemented. iOS soon to come!

This code is give as is, with no warrenties or guarenteed support. I'll do my best to accomodate any issues in my spare time. 

Hope someone finds this useful!
